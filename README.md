# Elm school of music

An attempt to port [HSoM](http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/hudak/Papers/HSoM.pdf) to elm 0.18. You can read the original Haskell source code [here](https://github.com/Euterpea/Euterpea2/blob/master/Euterpea/Music.lhs)

__A work in progress. Very incomplete__


To run the tests, install the latest version of the elm-test runner (currently 3.0.1), clone this repo and run:

    elm-test
