{- 2.4 Absolute Pitches -}

uses a type synonym to define the concept of an â€œabsolute pitch: -}

{- NOTE: I would prefer to use a Float -}

{-| Absolute Pitch -}
type alias AbsPitch = Int

{-| The absolute pitch of a Pitch -}
absPitch : Pitch -> AbsPitch
absPitch (pc, o) =
  12 * o + pcToInt pc


chromatic = [C, Cs, D, Ds, E, F, Fs, G, Gs, A, As, B]
{- NOTE: this is a hack. I don't want to return a Maybe... since ap % 2,
  I know positively it can't return Nothing -}

{-| Get the pitch class of an absolute pitch -}
pitchClass : AbsPitch -> PitchClass
pitchClass ap =
  case List.head (List.drop (ap % 12) chromatic) of
    Nothing -> C
    Just pc -> pc

{-| Get the octave of an absolute pitch -}
octave : AbsPitch -> Int
octave ap =
  if ap < 0 then (ap // 12) - 1 else ap // 12

{-| Converting an absolute pitch to a pitch is a bit more tricky, because of
enharmonic equivalences. For example, the absolute pitch 15 might correspond
to either (Ds, 1) or (Ef , 1). Euterpea takes the approach of always
returning a sharp in such ambiguous cases -}
pitch : AbsPitch -> Pitch
pitch ap =
  (pitchClass ap, octave ap)

{-| Given pitch and absPitch, it is now easy to define a function trans that
transposes pitches -}
trans : Int -> Pitch -> Pitch
trans i p =
  pitch (absPitch p + i)
